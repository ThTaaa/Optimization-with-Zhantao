Transform the image denoising model to a saddle point problem and using ADMM algorithm to solve it.

The test images used can be found in folder '**Figures**', '**TestImage**' and '**TestImage_2**'.

The functions we used are in folder '**Function**' or have already defined in matlab.

The results we got are stored in folder '**MatResults**'.
